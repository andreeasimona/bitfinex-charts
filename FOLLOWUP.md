# General:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

## Libraries used for development
   - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) used to manage the state of the project and to simulate the backend
   - [React Chart.js](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2) React wrapper for Chart.js 2
   - [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) HTML5 Charts using the canvas element
   - [Fort Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon set and toolkit used for the trend arrow

## Libraries used for testing
   - [fetch-mock](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock) mock http requests made using fetch
   - [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.
   - [enzyme-adapter-react-16](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) Adapter for enzyme with React 16
   - [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) an assertion library. It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code.
   - [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?

I spent 5 hours on the test

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

   - Improve the css and the overall User Experience
   - Persist the data in the chart on refresh
   - Improve the validation; Display erros messages to the user
   - Paint other values given by the bitfinex Api; The user should be able to choose from these values.
   - Make the chart interactive. The user should be able to configure a time frame for the chart.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I am most proud of the redux reducer (/src/state/reducer.js). I think is simple, logic and maintainable.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

The part I spend most time with was the unit tests. I have much more experience developing End to End tests using Selenium WebDriver.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I find the test fun and interesting to develop.
